## 1. Permute 2 objects of 2 distinct types in 4 spots.  

You're placing **2 A-type** and **2 B-type** objects into 4 positions. The number of **distinct permutations** is:  

$$  
\frac{4!}{2! \cdot 2!} = 6  
$$  

### Memory Trick:  
Think of the 4 spots as a 4-letter word made of 2 As and 2 Bs (e.g., AABB).  
To **remember** the count:  
* **Total ways to arrange 4 items** = 4!  
* But **A and B repeat**, so **divide by repeats**:  
  * 2! for A's  
  * 2! for B's  
* So:  $$  
  \frac{4!}{2! \cdot 2!} = 6  
  $$
