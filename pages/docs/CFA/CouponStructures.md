# Coupon Structures

- By convention always assume, coupons are semi-annual.

## Floating Rate Notes
Floating rate notes, often called "floaters," are a type of bond where the interest payments aren't fixed, but instead adjust up or down based on a market interest rate benchmark like the federal funds rate or SOFR, plus a set extra amount called a credit spread.

!!! attention
    Spread on a floating-rate note doesn’t change once the bond is issued. It’s baked into the deal, hard-coded in the fine print

### Inverse floaters
They’re issued by companies or governments betting they’ll look more creditworthy later, luring investors with the promise of higher payouts down the line while keeping early costs cheap.

## Step-up Coupon Bonds
These bonds have predetermined rate hikes baked into the contract—say, 3% for the first two years, 4% for the next three, 5% after that.

## Payment in Kind Bonds
Payment-in-kind (PIK) bonds let issuers skip cash interest payments by giving you more bonds or inflating your principal instead. It’s a move for companies too broke to pay now.

## Index Linked Bonds
Principal, coupons, or both are pegged to an index (usually inflation). Example: TIPS in the U.S.
- Buy $1,000 at 2% coupon.
- CPI rises 3% → principal becomes $1,030.
- Coupon = 2% × 1,030 = $20.60.
They hedge inflation, but tank in deflation or when real yields rip higher (see 2022 TIPS bloodbath).
