The yeild-to-maturity is the Internal Rate of Return on a coupon paying bond, if you held the bond to maturity and all the coupons were re-invested as soon as they were received.

The bond typically has two cash flows:
    - Cashflow from coupon
    - Cashflow from repayment from principal

$$ PV(PMT) = \sum_{t=1}^{N} \frac{C}{(1+y)^t} $$

and


$$ PV(FV) = \frac{FV}{(1+y)^N} $$

Therefore, the total PV is:

$$ PV = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{C}{(1+y)^t} + \frac{FV}{(1+y)^N} $$

Now solve for $y$ to get the yield from maturity.
