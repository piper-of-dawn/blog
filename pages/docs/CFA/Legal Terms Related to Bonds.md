# Bond Agreements – Cause / Effect / Purpose

**Indentures**
* **Definition (Cause)**: A formal contract between issuer and bondholders.
* **Effect**: Sets the legal framework — rights, duties, enforcement.
* **Purpose**: Prevents ambiguity. 

**Covenants**

* **Definition (Cause)**: Specific terms inside the indenture.
* **Effect**: They govern the issuer’s behavior during the life of the bond.
* **Purpose**: Protect bondholders from reckless or unfair issuer actions.

  * **Affirmative Covenants**

    * **Cause**: Obligations imposed on the issuer.
    * **Effect**: Forces transparency and accountability.
    * **Purpose**: Ensures investors get necessary info and compliance.
    * **Example**: Provide audited financial statements.

  * **Negative Covenants**

    * **Cause**: Restrictions placed on the issuer.
    * **Effect**: Limits risky financial decisions.
    * **Purpose**: Shields bondholders from dilution of claims.
    * **Examples**:

      * No pledging collateral twice.
      * Maintain debt/equity within limits.

**Bond Trustee**

* **Definition (Cause)**: Independent party appointed in the indenture.
* **Effect**: Acts on behalf of bondholders collectively.
* **Purpose**: Centralises enforcement, since individual investors lack leverage.

**Cross-Default Clause**

* **Definition (Cause)**: Provision linking defaults across multiple bonds.
* **Effect**: Default on one bond triggers default on others.
* **Purpose**: Prevents the issuer from selectively defaulting while paying other creditors.
* **Example**: Miss coupon on Bond B → holders of Bonds A and C can also declare default.

**Pari Passu**

* **Definition (Cause)**: Clause that equalises ranking across bonds.
* **Effect**: New bonds cannot jump ahead of existing ones in priority.
* **Purpose**: Protects bondholders from subordination and preserves fairness.
