## Event Loop  
At the heart of async is something called the event loop. Think of it as a super-organized waiter in a restaurant. This waiter doesn’t hover at one table until the food’s eaten—they zip around, checking which tables need attention. The event loop does the same: it’s a constant cycle that monitors tasks, schedules them when they’re ready to run, and handles their results when they’re done.   

   
 Why is it called a loop?

	5. Check for ready tasks   
	  6. Run them   
	  7. Check for new events (network data, timers, etc.)   
	  8. Go back to step 1   
	}
