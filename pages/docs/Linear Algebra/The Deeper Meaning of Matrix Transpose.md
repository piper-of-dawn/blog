### What are Covectors?

Covectors are linear functions that take a vector as input and produce a scalar (a number) as output.
They are described as "measuring devices" that assign a value to a vector in a way that respects linearity. For example:

If a covector measures vector $v_1$ as $a_1$ and $v_2$ as $a_2$, it measures: $v_1 + v_2$ as $a_1 + a_2$.
If a vector $v_1$ is scaled by a factor $\lambda$, the covector measures $\lambda v_1$as $\lambda a_1$.




Example in 2D:

A covector represented as$(a, b)$measures a vector$(x, y)$by computing$ax + by$, a linear combination that yields a scalar.
