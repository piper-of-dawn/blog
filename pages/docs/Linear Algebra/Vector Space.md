**TL;DR (First Principles):**  
A vector space is where linear algebra happens. If you can:  
* Add any two elements,  
* Multiply them by any scalar,  
* And still stay inside the same set,  
Then you're in a vector space.  

## Examples  

1. $\mathbb{R}^n$: Ordinary n-dimensional real space.  
2. Set of all $n \times m$ real matrices.  
3. Set of all polynomials with real coefficients.  
4. Set of all continuous functions on an interval.  
5. Set of 2D vectors lying in a plane through the origin in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

## Formal Definition  

A **vector space** $V$ over a field $\mathbb{F}$ (usually $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$) is a set equipped with two operations:  

1. **Vector addition**: $\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \in V$  
2. **Scalar multiplication**: $c\mathbf{v} \in V$, where $c \in \mathbb{F}$  

These operations must satisfy **8 axioms** (rules), such as:  

* **Closure** under addition and scalar multiplication  
* **Associativity**, **commutativity** of addition  
* **Distributivity** of scalar multiplication over scalars and vectors  
* Existence of **zero vector** and **additive inverses**  
* Multiplying by 1 leaves vector unchanged

## Intuition  

If you can:  

* Add any two elements,  
* Multiply them by any scalar,  
* And still stay inside the same set,  

Then you're in a vector space.

## Non-Examples  

* Vectors with a non-standard addition (e.g., max instead of +)  
* Vectors that can’t be scaled (e.g., integers aren't closed under division)

## Why It Matters  

Vector spaces provide the **stage** for linear algebra. Once you’re in a vector space:  

* You can apply linear maps (transformations).  
* You can define **bases**, **dimension**, and **coordinates**.  
* Concepts like span, linear independence, subspaces, and projections make sense.  

In short, vector spaces are **where linear algebra happens**.
