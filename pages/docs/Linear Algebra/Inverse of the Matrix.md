    A matrix that can be inverted is one that preserves the essential structure of the spaceâ€”**it may stretch, rotate, reflect, but it does not collapse dimensions or fold the space upon itself in an irreversible way**. The determinant, that mysterious quantity, what is it but a measure of how the transformation changes the "volume" of space?
