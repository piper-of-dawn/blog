I am a design-loving nerd, navigating the intersection of technology, mathematics and art, on this wild ride of figuring out ways to do something meaningful. Nowadays, I am deeply interested in the intersection of machine learning and computational finance.

Econometrics and Time-Series Analysis are my craft and thus I hunt patterns and weave stories with data for a living. I speak Hindi and English to humans, while Python and Javascript to computers. I also authored a Python library that facilitates comparison and testing of dataframes. I am currently learning deep learning, financial engineering and to speak Polish, C++ and Rust. In my free time, I work as a Pricing Quant at HSBC.
