Unions are pure first-principles: bits are bits, and you’re the one giving them meaning. Memory is just a sequence of bytes divided into slots. 

From this ground truth, a C++ union is as a single slot—say, 4 bytes—that can wear different hats: `union Data { int i; float f; char c; };` lets you store an `int`, a `float`, or a `char` in that one spot. Set `f = 3.14`, and those bytes (`0x4048F5C3`) are written on memory. It’s sized for the largest stored value (`float`), and you decide what’s active, no hand-holding from the compiler. If you overwrite ``f
with `int i = 3`. The value in the union is mutated and you have to manually keep a track of these mutations. **Avoid 'naked’ unions; wrap them in a class together with a type field;*

Compare this to a `struct`: it’s a wardrobe with a slot *per item*—an `int` slot, a `float` slot, a `char` slot—each with its own space (e.g., 9 bytes total for `struct Data { int i; float f; char c; };`). 

```cpp
union Data { int i; float f; char c; }; //one 4-byte chunk (sized for float)
Data d; d.i = 42; printf("%d\n", d.i); // 42
d.f = 3.14; printf("%f\n", d.f); // f overwrites i
enum { INT, FLOAT, CHAR } type; type = FLOAT; // you decide what’s live.  
```
