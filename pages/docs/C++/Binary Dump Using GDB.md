### TL;DR (First Principles):
When GDB executes a program, it maps your variables‚Äîincluding arrays and matrices‚Äîinto memory. You can tell GDB to **dump raw memory** of any variable to a binary file. This lets you **analyze the data outside GDB** (e.g., with Python + NumPy) without GDB choking on printing large data inline.
#### 1. **Understand What You're Dumping**
You need:
- The **starting memory address** (`&my_matrix`)
- The **exact byte size** to dump (`sizeof(my_matrix)`)
-
Example: for a `float my_matrix[100][100]`:
```cpp
sizeof(my_matrix) = 100 * 100 * sizeof(float) = 40000 bytes
```
#### 2. **Basic Syntax**
```gdb
dump binary memory <filename> <start_address> <end_address>
```

Or if you know the size:
```gdb
dump binary memory matrix.bin &my_matrix &my_matrix + sizeof(my_matrix)
```

But GDB doesn't support pointer arithmetic like that directly on `sizeof`. Instead:
```gdb
dump binary memory matrix.bin &my_matrix (&my_matrix)+40000
```
(You can replace `40000` with any exact byte count)

Or calculate in GDB: 
```
gdb p sizeof(my_matrix)
```

Then manually use the value:
```gdb
dump binary memory matrix.bin &my_matrix (&my_matrix)+40000
```

### What Happens Internally
- GDB interprets the address `&my_matrix` as a raw memory location.
- It writes the raw byte sequence (just 1s and 0s) to `matrix.bin`.
###  Load It in Python (Post-GDB)

```python
import numpy as np

data = np.fromfile("matrix.bin", dtype=np.float32)
matrix = data.reshape((100, 100))
print(matrix)
```

Make sure `dtype` and shape match your C++ matrix layout.
### üß™ Sanity Check in GDB

Want to confirm it‚Äôs dumping the correct values?

```gdb
x/10f &my_matrix[0][0]   # examine 10 floats
```

Then check if those match the first line of `matrix[0][:10]` in NumPy.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Pitfalls

- Don‚Äôt dump pointers unless they point to **contiguous** memory blocks.
    
- Avoid structs with padding unless you understand layout.
    
- Beware of endian issues if moving between architectures.
    

---

### Summary

- Use `dump binary memory` with known size + address
    
- Analyze externally with Python
    
- Great for debugging large matrices without cluttering your GDB session
